A proposed work flow for our final project may look like this:

Sydney:
1. git pull to get the latest work from the git hub repository 
2. Edit files.
3. git add to stage changes.
4. git commit -m "message" to record changes locally including a detailed but short message about the changes made
5. git push to share with Isa every 20/30 minutes that changes are made.
