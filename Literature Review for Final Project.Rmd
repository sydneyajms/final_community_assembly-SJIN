Effective pollinators in community assembly.

What community assemblages result in the greatest amount of nestdedness? (not sure if this addition is too much for the term project?)
Sydney James, Isabelle Nollette

## Literature review (~5 paragraphs)

### Paragraph 1 — Problem & significance (big‑picture reviews)
- Understanding the most positive indirect interactions among plant species may promote population persistence and species coexistence by enhancing individual reproductive success.
- The diversity and structure of pollinator communities can have important influences on floral evolution and reproductive interactions among plant species.
Typically, plant-pollinator communties are structured in a way that is considered nested, which is the structure for high resilience, yet this is not necessarily;y the most productive structure.

### Paragraph 2–3 — Past work & data landscape (who/where/how; gaps)
Existing literature in the field of community assembly has focused on how direct interactions among plants (e.g. competition for resources) and abiotic factors (e.g. soil moisture) influence their persistence in a particular habitat (@Sargent). Moreover, studies predicting how community and species characteristics such as niche overlaps, specialisation, trait divergence and distribution, and phylogenetics influence patterns of species co-occurrence and persistence within a community are not uncommon (@Moeller, @Ponisio, @Sargent, @Slingsby, J.A.). However, this research has little consideration for the role of plant-animal interactions in the greater community context, particularly that of the local pollinator networks as a potential habitat filter and driver of plant fitness. Instead, focus is often towards the scale of direct plant-animal interactions. 

Through deeper analysis on this existing literature, we can gain an understanding of current plant-pollinator network dynamics, where specialist pollinators are often found in greater abunadnce yet with lower diversity, and the inverse is true for generalist (@Moeller). Additionally, we know that plant species with similar flowering phenologies, and floral morphologies may compete for pollination, consequently making pollinator effectiveness and occurance a driver of reproductive success in communities with congeners (@Bell). There is also a wealth of research that outlines the two potential mechanisms of competition for pollination, as pollinator preference and improper pollen transfer, where the latter occurs when heterospecific pollen is deposited on stigmas of one or both competitors. Both of these mechanisms are important factors in plant-pollinator networks as they can be confounding on reproductive success, and limit the extent to which congeners can beneficially coexist (@Bell).

Surveys of floral visitor communities across large geographic ranges to examine the network of pollinators and their contribution to community assembly are frequent, and provide a strong framework for the methods of this study. Differently, the data for this project allows for the examination of pollination effectiveness at a smaller spatial scale, and focuses analysis in communities native to a defined ecoregion to enhance targeted restoration efforts. 


### Paragraph 4 — Purpose & why now

Wetland prairies are a critical part of the Oregon ecosystem. Wetland prairies are biodiversity hotspots that improve water quality, recharge groundwater, reduce flood severity, and support breeding and migrating wildlife. However, almost all remaining Willamette Valley prairies have been degraded by human pollution, invasive species, and altered water regimes. Thus, the need for restoration is unquestionably important. The role of pollinators is critical to the reproductive success of plant communities, and has delicate margins in doing so. Thus, research and data analysis such as this project can strengthen existing knowledge on community assembly and pollinator community composition, better informing specific restoration efforts, to prioritise the most productive community assemblages. Greater reproductive success within a plant community is known to be positively correlated to effective pollination, increasing overall ecosystem productivity and ultimately having a more meaningful impact on degraded landscapes like the wet prairies in the Willamette Valley. 

### Paragraph 5 — Hypotheses (directional) & brief rationale
Understanding research done by @Moeller(and others) on the degree of specialisation in pollinator communities visiting Clarkia plants across a wide geographic range is fundamental to the formation of our hypothesis. Building upon the understanding that the difference in pollinator communities between plant communities is due to the proportion of specialists versus generalists, rather than diversity, we form our first hypothesis:
We predict that Clarkia reproductive success will be greater in communities with less floral overlap and a more specialized pollinator community structure, due to reduced pollen interference and resource competition.
Conversely, we predict that communities with more congeners to Clarkia will attract greater overall abundance of pollinators, however reproductive success and pollinator biodiversity will be lower. 
Therefore, the optimal, most nested plant assemblage for restoration will feature limited plant overlap but high pollinator sharing.
