Effective pollinators in community assembly.

Which community assemblages promote the most biodiversity and abundance of effective pollinators? - What community assemblages result in the greatest amount of nestdedness? (not sure if this addition is too much for the term project?)
Sydney James, Isabelle Nollette

## Literature review (~5 paragraphs)

### Paragraph 1 — Problem & significance (big‑picture reviews)
…

### Paragraph 2–3 — Past work & data landscape (who/where/how; gaps)
Existing literature in the field of community assembly has focused on how direct interactions among plants (e.g. competition for resources) and abiotic factors (e.g. soil moisture) influence the persistence of plants in a particular habitat (@Sargent). Moreover, studies predicting how community characteristics such as niche overlaps, trait divergence and distribution, and phylogenetics influence patterns of species co-occurrence and persistence within a community are not uncommon (@Ponisio, @Sargent). However, research on plant communities has little consideration for the role of plant-animal interactions in the greater community context, particularly that of the local pollinator networks as a potential habitat filter, and rather tends to narrowly focus on the scale of direct plant-animal interactions. (@Sargent)

### Paragraph 4 — Purpose & why now

Wetland prairies are a critical part of the Oregon ecosystem. Wetland prairies are biodiversity hotspots that improveing water quality, recharge groundwater, reduce flood severity, and support breeding and migrating wildlife. However, almost all remaining Willamette Valley prairies have been degraded by human pollution, invasive species, and altered water regimes. Thus, the need for restoration is unquestionably important, and critically, towards the role of pollinators in supporting these enabling plant reproduction is crucial.

### Paragraph 5 — Hypotheses (directional) & brief rationale
Understanding research done by @Moeller(and others) on the degree of specialisation in pollinator communities visiting Clarkia plants across a wide geographic range is fundamental to the formation of our hypothesis. Building upon the understanding that the difference in pollinator communities between plant communities is due to the proportion of specialists versus generalists, rather than diversity, we form our first hypothesis:

We predict that Clarkia reproductive success will be greater in communities with less floral overlap and a more specialized pollinator community structure, due to reduced pollen interference and resource competition.

Conversely, we predict that communities with more congeners to Clarkia will attract greater overall abundance of pollinators, however reproductive success and pollinator biodiversity will be lower. 

Therefore, the optimal, most nested plant assemblage for restoration will feature limited plant overlap but high pollinator sharing.
