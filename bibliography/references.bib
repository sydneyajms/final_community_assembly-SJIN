	abstract = {Ecological restoration often involves only the manipulation of abiotic factors at the local scale. However, processes external to a restoration site determine the range of local conditions within the site, constraining the level of restoration progress that can be achieved by on-site manipulations. We examined the relationship of landscape and local explanatory variables to plant species composition in 28 restored wetlands in Illinois, USA. Using constrained ordination combined with variation partitioning, we determined the independent and joint effects of three spatially hierarchical sets of variables: (1) macroscale landscape features reﬂecting site setting within regional landscapes, (2) mesoscale landscape features reﬂecting nearby propagule sources and buffers from disturbances, and (3) local environmental factors. Because the relative inﬂuence of landscape- vs. local-scale factors on restoration success may depend on particular restoration goals, we repeated the analyses using three multivariate plant community responses that represented three frequently stated goals: (1) replicating species composition, (2) restoring a particular wetland community type, and (3) constructing sites with high value for plant conservation. Explanatory variables at landscape and local scales had independent and nearly equally strong relationships to plant species composition. In contrast, when species were aggregated based on plant traits, the independent contribution of local predictors was greater than the independent contributions of macroscale or mesoscale landscape predictors, reﬂecting convergence of plant trait composition in sites with similar local conditions. Local predictors explained a signiﬁcant amount of variation in plant conservation value among sites, but much of the variation could be explained by largescale landscape setting, indicating that landscape constraints on local environmental conditions limited the level of ﬂoristic conservation value achievable. The appropriate scale at which to focus restoration efforts will vary depending upon restoration objectives. Restoration of particular wetland community types might be successfully achieved through manipulation of local abiotic factors. In contrast, restoration of a particular species assemblage or reconstruction of wetlands with high value for conservation requires consideration of landscape processes and available species pools.},

	abstract = {Flowering plants do not occur alone and often grow in mixed‐species communities where pollinator sharing is high and interactions via pollinators can occur at pre‐ and post‐pollination stages. While the causes and consequences of pre‐pollination interactions have been well studied little is known about post‐pollination interactions via heterospecific pollen (HP) receipt, and even less about the evolutionary implications of these interactions. In particular, the degree to which plants can evolve tolerance mechanisms to the negative effects of HP receipt has received little attention. Here, we aim to fill this gap in our understanding of post‐pollination interactions by experimentally testing whether two co‐flowering
              Clarkia
              species can evolve HP tolerance, and whether tolerance to specific HP ‘genotypes’ (fine‐scale local adaptation to HP) occurs. We find that
              Clarkia
              species vary in their tolerance to HP effects. Furthermore, conspecific pollen performance and the magnitude of HP effects were related to the recipient's history of exposure to HP in
              C. xantiana
              but not in
              C. speciosa
              . Specifically, better conspecific pollen performance and smaller HP effects were observed in populations of
              C. xantiana
              plants with previous exposure to HP compared to populations without such exposure. These results suggest that plants may have the potential to evolve tolerance mechanisms to HP effects but that these may occur not from the female (stigma, style) but from the male (pollen) perspective, a possibility that is often overlooked. We find no evidence for fine‐scale local adaptation to HP receipt. Studies that evaluate the adaptive potential of plants to the negative effects of HP receipt are an important first step in understanding the evolutionary consequences of plant–plant post‐pollination interactions. Such knowledge is in turn crucial for deciphering the role of plant–pollinator interactions in driving floral evolution and the composition of co‐flowering communities.},

	abstract = {While pollinators and wetlands both provide important ecosystem services (e.g., the pollination of flowering plants and improving water quality), the relationship between the two is not well understood. Both biotic and abiotic effects can mediate the local wetland flower and pollinator community. In this study, we investigated how land use, including a land use gradient at five different radii, from 250 m to 2 km, along with anthropogenic disturbance affected pollinators in wetland ecosystems. We surveyed the abundance and diversity of plantpollinator communities in fifteen different wetlands across two years. We also tested the relationship between water quality and temperature, and the abundance and diversity of flowering plants and pollinating insects. Our results suggest that increasing temperature, which was strongly associated with developed land use, had a negative effect on the floral display of wetland plants, as well as the abundance of all flower visitors and hover flies. Hover fly abundance was also positively associated with agricultural land use and total nitrogen in the water. Meanwhile, the abundance of female bees was affected by an interaction between temperature and disturbance: female bees were most abundant when temperatures were lower in areas of low disturbance. In contrast, pollinator species richness increased with temperature when developed land use was low, and floral diversity was strongly affected by several interactions between disturbance, land use, and water quality. Finally, the community composition of both plants and insects varied significantly among low, medium, and high disturbance categories, with weedier, non-native species being significantly associated with areas of higher disturbance and in sites with greater anthropogenic land use. We demonstrate that ecological communities shift significantly in response to anthropogenic change. Our work also illustrates the importance of quantifying interactions between land use and local disturbance with abiotic factors such as temperature and water quality on ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Sympatric plant species with similar ﬂowering phenologies and ﬂoral morphologies may compete for pollination, and as a consequence potentially inﬂuence each other’s reproductive success and mating system. Two likely competitors are Mimulus ringens and Lobelia siphilitica, which co-occur in wet meadows of central and eastern North America, produce blue zygomorphic ﬂowers, and share several species of bumble bee pollinators. To test for effects of competition for pollination, we planted experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In two arrays we planted mixtures of Mimulus and Lobelia, and in two additional arrays we planted Mimulus without a competitor for pollination. Bumble bee pollinators frequently moved between Mimulus and Lobelia ﬂowers in the mixed-species arrays, with 42\% of plant-to-plant movements being interspeciﬁc transitions. Pollinator movements between species were associated with a reduction in the amount of conspeciﬁc pollen arriving on Mimulus stigmas. The presence of Lobelia led to a signiﬁcant 37\% reduction in the mean number of Mimulus seeds per fruit. In addition, Mimulus had a signiﬁcantly lower rate of outcrossing in the mixed-species arrays (0.43) than in the ‘‘pure’’ arrays (0.63). This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that competition for pollination directly inﬂuences outcrossing rates. Our work suggests that in self-compatible populations with genetic load, competition for pollination may not only reduce seed quantity, but may also lower seed quality.},

We use data from 11 existing vegetation surveys to test whether co-occurrence in schoenoid sedge assemblages in the Cape Floristic Region shows signiﬁcant phylogenetic structuring and to examine whether this changes with the phylogenetic scale of the analysis. We provide evidence for phylogenetic overdispersion in an alliance of closely related species (the reticulate-sheathed Tetraria clade) using both quantile regression analysis and a comparison between the mean observed and expected phylogenetic distances between co-occurring species. Similar patterns are not evident when the analyses are performed at a broader phylogenetic scale. Examination of six functional traits suggests a general pattern of trait conservatism within the reticulate-sheathed Tetraria clade, suggesting a potential role for interspeciﬁc competition in structuring co-occurrence within this group. We suggest that phylogenetic overdispersion of communities may be common throughout many of the Cape lineages, since interspeciﬁc interactions are likely intensiﬁed in lineages with large numbers of species restricted to a small geographic area, and we discuss the potential implications for patterns of diversity in the Cape.},

	abstract = {We present a population genetic model that incorporates aspects of pollinator efﬁciency and abundance to examine the effect of the local plant community on the evolution of ﬂoral trait specialization. Our model predicts that plant species evolve to be pollinator specialists on the most effective and common pollinators when their abundance is low relative to other plant species in the community (i.e., conspeciﬁc pollen is relatively rare) and evolve to be pollinator generalists when they are numerically dominant (i.e., conspeciﬁc pollen is abundant). Strong ﬂower constancy also favors generalist ﬂoral traits. Furthermore, generalist species are predicted to differentiate when there is a concave trade-off in attracting pollinator species with different ﬂoral trait preferences. This result implies that populations that evolve toward a generalist strategy may be more prone to speciation. Ours is the ﬁrst theoretical model to include local species abundance explicitly, despite the fact that it has been previously identiﬁed as an important factor in the evolution of plant specialization. Our results add a layer of ecological complexity to previous models of ﬂoral evolution and therefore have the potential to improve our power to predict circumstances under which specialized and generalized plant-pollinator interactions should evolve.},

Most studies on indirect interactions have focused on how they affect predator-prey or competitive relationships. However, it is equally likely that indirect interactions play an important structuring role in mutualistic relationships in a natural community. We demonstrate experimentally that on a small spatial scale, dense thickets of endemic Pandanus plants have a strong positive trait-mediated indirect effect on the reproduction of the declining endemic Mauritian plant Trochetia blackburniana. This effect is mediated by the endemic gecko Phelsuma cepediana moving between Pandanus thickets, a preferred microhabitat, and nearby T. blackburniana plants, where it feeds on nectar and pollinates the plants. Our ﬁndings emphasize the importance of considering plant-animal interactions such as pollination at relatively small spatial scales in both basic ecological studies and applied conservation management.},

We ﬁnd that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment –the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts.

Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial heterogeneity and turnover in community composition (b-diversity). While some techniques are known to enhance a-diversity, it is unclear whether habitat restoration can re-establish b-diversity. Using a long-term pollinator dataset, comprising 9,800 specimens collected from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central Valley of California, we show that onfarm habitat restoration in the form of native plant ‘hedgerows’, when replicated across a landscape, can boost b-diversity by approximately 14\% relative to unrestored ﬁeld margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows restore b-diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological ﬁlter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small-scale restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.},
